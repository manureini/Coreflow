# Coreflow

With Coreflow you can create flows similar to Windows Workflow Foundation and Microsoft Flow
and run them locally using the Coreflow Library.

A flow will be converted to C# Code and compiled with Roslyn and .NET Core.

This software was implemented during my Bachelor Thesis from March to June 2019.
